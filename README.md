# Super-Resolution-GAN

## Final project for AI CS362 course.

Description:

Image Super-Resolution is a machine learning process used to make images
clearer and more detailed by increasing their resolution. The aim is to keep
the original content and details intact. The outcome is a sharper version
of the original image. The main goal was to delve into the application of GANs 
for this task, and as a result implement working solution based on paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04802v5
